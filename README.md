My learning was focused on making a colorful and surprising UX for this application, to test whether the novel cards or the familiar cards are easier to match.

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I would update my media queries and would focus on a mobile-first approach. I would then work on adding a timing feature and leaderboard

## Lessons Learned:

Don't forget to update the media queries to make sure everyone can see your content, rather than just the people that have a screen size like yours.
